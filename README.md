CPU Scheduling Algorithms
Welcome to my CPU Scheduling Algorithms repository! This project showcases various CPU scheduling techniques, both preemptive and non-preemptive, implemented in C. These algorithms are fundamental to operating systems, ensuring efficient process management and resource allocation.

Algorithms Implemented
Non-Preemptive Scheduling
First-Come, First-Served (FCFS)
With and without arrival time considerations
Shortest Job First (SJF)
With and without arrival time considerations
Priority Scheduling
With and without arrival time considerations
Preemptive Scheduling
Priority Scheduling (Preemptive)
Shortest Remaining Time First (SRTF)
Round Robin Scheduling
Each algorithm is implemented with careful consideration of real-world scenarios, handling processes with different arrival times, burst times, and priorities.

Getting Started
Clone this repository to explore and experiment with various CPU scheduling algorithms:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/divyanshupatel17/Operating-System.git
Each folder contains C code that implements the corresponding scheduling algorithm. Simply navigate to the desired folder, compile the code using gcc, and run the executable.
